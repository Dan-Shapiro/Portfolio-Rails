<h2>About</h2>
<hr>
<p>
	I'm Dan Shapiro, a <span class="em">developer</span> and <span class="em">rock climber</span> living on <span class="em">Long Island</span>. I recently graduated from the <span class="em">University of Virginia</span> with a bachelor of science degree in <span class="em">computer science</span>. I'm interested in web development, human-computer interaction, game theory, machine learning and software engineering.
</p>
<p>
	Outside the confines of my screen I fill my free time with rock climbing, board games, crafts or I dabble in something new. I love the show Survivor and I'll never turn down a night out for some wings.
